## Introduction

This lesson breaks down protected swings (also called protected highs and lows) and demonstrates how traders can use them to anticipate market direction, refine entries, and maintain strong risk-to-reward ratios.

## What is a Protected Swing?

A protected swing represents a high or low you expect to hold if the current trend continues.

**Directional Applications:**
- **Bullish:** Expects a recent low to remain intact while price trends higher
- **Bearish:** Expects a recent high to remain intact while price trends lower

### Two Formation Methods

**Highs and Lows (Sweep-Based):**
- Bullish: Price runs below a short-term low (liquidity sweep), then closes above the series of down-close candles that formed that low
- Bearish: Price runs above a short-term high, then closes below the series of up-close candles that formed that high

**Fair Value Gaps (FVG-Based):**
- Price trades into a fair value gap, then closes above (bullish) or below (bearish) the series of candles that created the gap
- This closure confirms the swing as protected

## Why Protected Swings Matter

Protected swings provide market structure points that:
- Define trend continuation
- Provide clear invalidation levels for stop placement
- Help avoid false reversals
- Guide trade direction (only trading aligned with protected swings)

## Practical Applications

### Reversal to Bearish Trend

When price swept previous highs but failed to close below the up-close candle series, no protected high formed. Later, price swept the high again and closed below that series, confirming a protected high and flipping the market bearish. Subsequent retracements into key levels offered sell opportunities with the protected high as invalidation.

### Continuation Using Protected High

Once a protected high is established, each subsequent reach into an important level and close below an up-close candle series creates new protected highs. These become stepping stones for continuation entries.

### Lower Timeframe Refinement

When hourly charts show protected swing formation:
1. Wait for price to retest the opening price in the series
2. Drop to the 5-minute chart
3. Look for a lower timeframe protected swing
4. Enter on continuation with stop on the protected high

This approach achieves cleaner risk-to-reward by using lower timeframe entries to target higher timeframe levels.

## Anticipation vs. Confirmation

Traders can anticipate protected swings forming at key levels (inside fair value gaps), but only confirm when the candle closes through the correct series. This distinction allows for lower timeframe entries aligned with daily narrative direction.

## Key Trading Takeaways

- Always wait for the close beyond the correct candle series for confirmation
- Use protected swings as invalidation; stops go beyond the swing
- In trending markets: sell from protected highs (bearish) and buy from protected lows (bullish)
- Protected swings apply to both reversal and continuation setups
- Pair with higher timeframe closures for additional confirmation

Protected swings function as essential market structure tools that maintain trend alignment while providing precise entry and invalidation points for disciplined, structure-focused trading.
