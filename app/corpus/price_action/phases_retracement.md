## What Is a Retracement?

A retracement represents the inverse of an expansion phase:

- **Expansion:** Rapid, forceful directional movement
- **Retracement:** Gradual, modest move opposing the prevailing trend

Think of retracements as the market pausing before continuing in its primary direction.

In bullish scenarios:
1. Price moves upward rapidly
2. Gradually retreats in a shallow correction
3. Resumes upward momentum in a new expansion phase

## Key Traits of a Retracement

Retracements follow identifiable patterns:

- Typically emerge following robust expansions
- Generally penetrate into price delivery (PD) arrays, frequently fair value gaps (FVG)
- Display failure swings at highs during bullish retracements or at lows during bearish retracements
- Maintain structural integrity without breaching the protected swing confirming the trend

**Important consideration:** An overly deep retracement risks transitioning into a reversal. Shallow, controlled pullbacks signal healthy trend continuation.

## How to Trade Retracements

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Spot Expansions**
Identify a clear, forceful unidirectional move with strong momentum

**2. Wait for the Pullback**
Allow price to ease into a PD array (FVG, order block, etc.). Avoid premature entries.

**3. Look for Confirmation**
Confirmation signals include:
- Candle 2 closure in the Fractal Model
- Protected swing formation at the PD array

**4. Enter with Structure in Mind**
Execute trades on the confirmation candle or following a retest. Position stop losses near the protected swing.

**5. Target Liquidity**
Direct positions toward logical liquidity pools - previous highs/lows or key imbalances

## When Retracements Do Not Happen

Powerful expansions sometimes bypass the retracement phase entirely, moving directly into consolidation or subsequent expansion phases.

When this occurs:
- Either await a valid retracement opportunity
- Examine lower timeframes for clearer movement patterns

## Combining with the Phases of Price

Retracements function as a single component within a broader sequence:

**Expansion -> Retracement -> Expansion**

Understanding your current phase enables traders to:
- Anticipate where subsequent opportunities will likely emerge
- Determine how far price can reasonably correct before invalidating the trend

## Key Takeaways

- Retracements constitute shallow, controlled moves against prevailing trends
- Search for them in fair value gaps, ideally accompanied by failure swings
- Confirm entries using protected swings or Candle 2 closure signals
- Not every expansion generates a retracement opportunity - this is normal
- Integrate retracements within the complete Phases of Price framework for comprehensive trading guidance
