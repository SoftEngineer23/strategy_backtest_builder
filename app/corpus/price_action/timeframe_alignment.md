## Introduction

Time frame alignment is a critical component of top-down analysis, allowing traders to connect higher time frame bias with lower time frame entries. This guide explains how to implement a structured three-layer approach to trading analysis for improved entry precision.

## Understanding the Three Layers of Time Frame Analysis

The trading methodology divides analysis into three interconnected timeframe levels:

1. **Higher Time Frame (Bias)** - Establishes the directional bias for the market
2. **Intermediate Time Frame (Structure)** - Validates alignment with bias using change in state of delivery (CISD) and market structure confirmation
3. **Entry Time Frame (Entry)** - Delivers the specific execution opportunity

This layered approach ensures all timeframes work in concert to create expansion conditions.

## Confirming Higher Time Frame Bias

The bias determination uses multiple analytical tools:

- Swing points analysis
- Candle closure positioning
- Equilibrium levels
- Internal and external liquidity identification
- Phases of price analysis

## Aligning Structural Time Frame

Once bias is established, move to the structural timeframe to:

- Verify structural alignment (CISD) with the bias timeframe before seeking entries
- Identify key interest points including:
  - Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)
  - Significant highs or lows
  - Order blocks

When price interacts with and respects these levels, proceed to the entry timeframe analysis.

## Dropping to the Entry Time Frame

The entry timeframe provides precision triggers by:

- Waiting for entry timeframe alignment with both bias and structure (CISD)
- Identifying continuation order blocks or protected swings forming in the anticipated direction

When all three time frames align in the same direction, that is when expansion conditions occur.

## Time Frame Pairings

Recommended alignment combinations:

- Weekly -> 4-Hour
- Daily -> 1-Hour
- 4-Hour -> 15-Minute
- 1-Hour -> 5-Minute
- 30-Minute -> 3-Minute
- 15-Minute -> 1-Minute

For example, targeting a 5-minute entry requires 1-hour structure confirmation and daily bias alignment.

## Example: 30-Minute to 3-Minute Intraday Reversal

**30-Minute Structure:** Bullish reversal anticipated following a bullish 30-minute candle closure after intraday low sweeps.

**3-Minute Entry:** CISD forms on the 3-minute chart with a continuation setup. Positional entry at candle open with stops below both the 30-minute equilibrium and the breaker low allows price to develop the FVG below if continuation forms.

**Outcome:** Price expands higher, followed by consolidation, then additional expansion. Following price phases (Expansion - Consolidation - Expansion), sweeping the low creates a new protected swing signaling further upside.

## Key Takeaways

- Trade exclusively when all timeframes align directionally
- Allow the higher timeframe to establish direction, structural timeframe to confirm alignment, and entry timeframe to deliver precision
- Avoid forcing trades during timeframe misalignment; wait for complete alignment to maximize probability
