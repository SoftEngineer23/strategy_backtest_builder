## Introduction

Building a strong entry model requires clarity and focus rather than memorizing every concept. This approach guides traders through key ideas, application methods, and the flow of reversals to develop a personalized entry strategy.

## Understanding Kill Zones

Timing is critical for meaningful setups. Key trading windows include:

- **New York AM Session** (8:30-11:00 EST): Primary focus for index trading
- **London Session** (2:00-5:00 AM EST): Earlier action opportunity

The 5-minute chart offers an optimal balance, providing structure while maintaining alignment with daily profiles and avoiding excessive noise.

## Core Concepts for Entry Models

Focus on one or two primary tools rather than overwhelming yourself with everything available:

### Fair Value Gap (FVG)
A three-candle pattern that leaves imbalance.

### Inversion
When a fair value gap gets closed and later becomes support or resistance.

### Order Block
The last up or down candle before a move that defines structure.

### Breaker Block
A structural shift where a previously failed level gets reused as an entry point.

### Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)
Uses Fibonacci retracement - particularly the 70.5% level - for continuation trades.

## Adding Confluences

Stack additional confidence factors onto your primary concept:

- **Premium and Discount Zones**: The 50% line of a range acts as a dividing level (above = sells, below = buys)
- **SMT Divergence**: When correlated assets show disagreement (such as one asset creating a higher low while another creates a lower low), reversals often follow

Avoid overcomplication; include only enough confluence to feel confident executing trades.

## How Reversals Form: The Sequence

Reversals follow a predictable pattern:

1. **Purge / Turtle Soup**: Sweep of liquidity at significant highs or lows
2. **Inversion**: Price reclaims a fair value gap
3. **Change in State of Delivery (CISD)**: A candle closes through opposing candles, confirming the shift
4. **Fair Value Gap**: Three-candle imbalance pattern emerges
5. **Breaker Block**: Final structural piece before expansion in the opposite direction

The further along this sequence you progress, the more confirmation accumulates - though entries become later as well.

## Finding Your Model

The most effective entry model aligns with your natural trading style. Consistency in application matters more than complexity. Once you identify your preferred approach, repeat it until it becomes instinctive.

## Key Takeaways

- Focus on mastering one or two core concepts rather than everything
- Use kill zones to time entries during high-probability sessions
- The reversal sequence provides a structured framework: Purge -> Inversion -> CISD -> FVG -> Breaker
- Add confluence factors selectively to build confidence without overcomplication
- Consistency in execution matters more than complexity of the model
