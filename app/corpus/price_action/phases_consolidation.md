## What Is a Consolidation?

A consolidation occurs when price remains trapped between a defined high and low without breaking either boundary for an extended duration. Think of it as the market catching its breath:

- Price compresses from a large range into a smaller one
- Market momentum gets stored for the subsequent expansion

Consolidations typically develop:
- Following a substantial range expansion
- When price approaches a higher timeframe level

## Why Consolidation Matters

Within the range, price activity becomes unpredictable and erratic. Rather than attempting to guess which direction the breakout will go, the more effective approach involves:

- **Anticipating manipulation** - watching for liquidity sweeps of one range boundary
- **Trading away from swept side** - positioning after the manipulation confirms

This aligns with the traditional Power of Three framework: Accumulation -> Manipulation -> Distribution.

An alternative approach is to:
- Wait for confirmed range breakout plus subsequent continuation

**Pro Tip:** A legitimate breakout happens when price fails to manipulate a boundary and does not close back inside the range, creating a new continuation setup on the retest.

## Types of Consolidations

### Continuation Consolidation

This pattern develops mid-trend without reaching higher timeframe objectives. Expect price to break in the prevailing trend's direction following either a sweep of the opposite boundary or a legitimate breakout.

### Reversal Consolidation

This pattern forms after reaching a higher timeframe level. It frequently signals a potential trend reversal if accompanied by a liquidity sweep plus a change in the state of delivery (CISD).

## How to Trade Consolidations

### Define the Range
Mark precisely where price has remained confined - the high and low boundaries.

### Wait for Manipulation
Price sweeps one range boundary:
- **Bullish** - look for low sweep
- **Bearish** - look for high sweep

### Confirm With Change in State of Delivery (CISD)
Wait for closure through opposing candles (protected swing formation) confirming the manipulation.

### Execute the Trade
- Enter on the continuation following CISD confirmation
- Position stop-loss beyond the protected swing
- Target liquidity pools (equal highs/lows, fair value gaps)

## Smart Money Technique (SMT) in Consolidation

Even if your primary market does not sweep a level, you can treat it as swept if a correlated market accomplishes this. For example: Nasdaq stays contained, but S&P 500 sweeps the low - treat Nasdaq's low as protected once CISD confirms on the S&P.

## Using Equilibrium in Consolidations

Calculate the EQ (50%) of the range:
- Price tends toward EQ if consolidation persists
- Deviations typically revert to EQ until breakout occurs

## Key Takeaways

- Consolidation represents price pausing between defined boundaries
- Avoid trading inside the range blindly
- Anticipate manipulation, confirm with CISD, then trade continuation or reversal setups
- Apply SMT to validate opportunities even without direct market sweeps
- Equilibrium serves as a valuable reference for understanding price behavior within the range
