## What Is a Reversal in Trading?

A reversal occurs when strong price movement in one direction meets equally aggressive expansion in the opposite direction. Unlike continuations where price expands, retraces, then resumes the same direction, reversals signal a complete trend change - making them valuable trading opportunities.

## Key Areas Where Price Reversals Form

Reversals develop at specific liquidity zones rather than random price points:

- **Previous highs and lows** - Prior day or prior week structural levels serve as reliable reversal catalysts
- **Significant swing points** - Structural pivots where price previously changed direction

**Pro Tip:** Focus on relevant levels (previous day's high/low, weekly extremes, session boundaries) rather than arbitrary points. These zones repeatedly attract price action and generate high-probability setups.

## How to Identify a Reversal: Step-by-Step

### Expansion Met with Expansion
Strong directional movement immediately followed by equally strong or stronger movement in the opposite direction signals a potential reversal.

### Higher Time Frame Wick
On higher timeframes, reversals often display extended rejection wicks - visual evidence of sharp rejection at key levels.

### V-Shaped Reversals
The cleanest reversals form sharp "V" patterns where price sweeps a level then snaps back aggressively, closing through the same level.

### Change in State of Delivery (CISD)
A shift in price movement mechanics, momentum, and order flow flipping - confirmed by candle closure through the series that created the high (bearish) or low (bullish).

### Candle Closure Confirmation
Wait for candle closure before committing to trades. This confirmation prevents false reversals that resolve as simple retracements, particularly when price closes back through the key level.

### Liquidity Sweeps
Optimal reversals frequently take out previous extremes, trapping breakout traders before price reverses sharply.

## How to Trade Price Reversals

Follow this structured framework:

1. **Start on Higher Time Frames** - Identify major highs and lows as probable reversal zones

2. **Drop to Lower Time Frames** - Watch for reversal signatures such as expansion meeting expansion or V-shaped patterns

3. **Wait for Protection** - Confirm with protected swing structure or candle closure before entry

4. **Trade the Continuation** - Once confirmed, pursue the move in the new direction, targeting the next liquidity pool

**Example:** When price sweeps the previous day's high and immediately displays strong downward expansion, enter to trade lower toward the next liquidity zone.

## How Reversals Fit Into the Phases of Price

Reversals operate within a broader market sequence:

**Expansion -> Reversal -> Retracement -> Continuation**

A confirmed reversal may lead to a clean continuation or a small retracement before resuming. Higher timeframe closures further validate reversal setups and refine timing.

## Key Takeaways

- A reversal occurs when expansion meets expansion in the opposite direction
- Target high-probability levels like previous day/week highs or lows
- Watch for reversal signatures: higher timeframe wicks, liquidity sweeps, V-shaped moves
- Confirm with candle closures and pursue the continuation
- Blend reversals with other price phases for strongest setups
