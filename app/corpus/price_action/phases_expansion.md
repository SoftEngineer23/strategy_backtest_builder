## What Is Expansion?

Expansion represents a strong directional move characterized by:

- **Large range candles** moving decisively in one direction
- **Shallow retracements** that fail to reverse the trend significantly
- **Bullish expansion**: Upward price movement with minor pullbacks
- **Bearish expansion**: Downward price movement with minimal bounces

The phase displays momentum and trending strength with limited counter-movement against the primary direction.

## When Does Expansion Occur?

Expansion typically emerges from smaller price ranges and reflects the market's natural cycle:

- After consolidation breakouts with momentum
- Following shallow retracements when the trend resumes
- Pattern sequence: Small range -> Large range -> Small range

## Recognition Characteristics

Key identifying features include:

- Shallow pullbacks opposing the main trend
- Protected swings forming throughout the move
- Price respecting opposing candles as support/resistance
- **Bullish context**: Down-close candles act as support levels
- **Bearish context**: Up-close candles function as resistance levels

**Professional technique**: Use the EQ (Equilibrium) method - focus on the upper half of higher timeframe candles in bullish setups and the lower half in bearish setups.

## Trading Expansion Phases

### Step-by-Step Approach

**1. Identify Higher Timeframe Context**
- Use daily charts or higher to spot reversals or breakouts

**2. Mark Protected Swings**
- Track lower timeframe levels that should not be violated if the trend continues

**3. Look for Points of Interest (POI)**
- Watch for fair value gaps and candle closures
- Bullish: Closures above opposing candles
- Bearish: Closures below opposing candles

**4. Execute With Trend**
- Enter after confirmation signals
- Place stops at protected swings
- Target liquidity pools (prior highs/lows)

## Chart Patterns to Monitor

- **Large Range -> Small Range -> Large Range**: Classic trend continuation setup
- **Three-Day Rule**: Extended expansions typically yield to consolidation, retracement, or reversal
- **Manipulation Failure**: If price fails to reverse key levels during consolidation, trend usually resumes in the expansion direction (breakout)

## Fractal Application Across Timeframes

The expansion concept works consistently across all timeframes:

- Daily/hourly for swing trading
- Hourly/5-minute for intraday trading
- 15-minute/1-minute for scalping
- Monthly/daily for macro setups

Timeframe alignment significantly improves trade probability.

## Key Takeaways

- Expansion equals strong one-directional movement with minimal retracements
- Usually follows consolidation or retracement phases
- Protected swings confirm trend validity and manage risk
- Higher timeframe context establishes directional bias
- Multiple days of expansion signal preparation for phase change
